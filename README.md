## Technical Details

- UI Prototype using _SwiftUI_ Framework
- developed for iPhone with iOS17 or newer

This is by no means supposed to be a functional application and contains no backend or application logic whatsoever. It is rather thought to be a showcase how such an app might look and feel like.
